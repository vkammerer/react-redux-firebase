# Webpack + React + Redux + Firebase

Starter Kit / Boilerplate to use React, Redux and Firebase in an ES2015 codebase compiled with Webpack.  

A version of this app is visible at [vkammerer.github.io/react-redux-firebase](http://vkammerer.github.io/react-redux-firebase)  

This was originally an adaptation of the article [http://blog.krawaller.se/posts/a-react-redux-firebase-app-with-authentication](http://blog.krawaller.se/posts/a-react-redux-firebase-app-with-authentication), but the application and the code have been simplified afterwards.

```javascript
npm i
